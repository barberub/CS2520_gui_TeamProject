 - Note: We worked on these files together prior to being uploaded to GitHub.

## Requirements:
You need PyQt6 in order to run this program.

## How to Run:
Simply run encryption_gui.py.  Ensure encryptionRSA.py and encryptionSimple.py are in the same directory.

## Capabilities:
At the current version, the GUI includes simple implementations of the following encryption and decryption methods:
- RSA (Asymetric encryption model)
- Caesar Cipher (Basic alphabetic shift)
- Substitution Cipher (Basic alphabetic substitution)
- Vigenere Cipher (Basic alphabetic shift based off of a keyword)

## Files:
 - CS2520_Project.ui: a .ui file to be used by QtDesigner or other Designer files to assist in the UI creation process.
 - encryption_gui.py: The main file to be ran.  Contains all the UI code in python form.
 - encryptionRSA.py: All methods, including testing, to deal with RSA encryption.
 - encryptionSimple.py: Includes the methods for encrypting, decrypting, and testing Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher.
